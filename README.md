[Sui Toolkit](https://toolkit.wal.app/) is a practical toolset created for Sui blockchain developers and users, designed to simplify interaction with the Sui blockchain.

The Sui Toolkit frontend code has been deployed on the Walrus platform. Walrus adopts a decentralized storage architecture, ensuring distributed storage of application data, which enhances security and reliability, providing users with a stable and censorship-resistant access experience.

## Features

Currently, Sui Toolkit offers the following features:

- [Batch Transfer](https://toolkit.wal.app/bulk-transfer): Conveniently transfer SUI tokens to multiple addresses simultaneously
- [Faucet](https://toolkit.wal.app/faucet): Quickly obtain testnet SUI tokens for development and testing

We plan to continuously expand the functionality of Sui Toolkit by adding more practical tools to further enhance the development experience in the Sui ecosystem.
